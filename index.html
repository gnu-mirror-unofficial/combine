<h2>GNU Combine</h2>

<p>GNU Combine is a tool for working with record-oriented data files.  The biggest thing it does
is to expand on the join utility by allowing multiple keys in the join, working with more than one
file to match to a base data file, working with unsorted files and providing a variety of flagging 
and aggregation options to summarize the results of the match.  It is also extensible with Guile, 
so that you can do what you need to do at any point in the processing to adjust what's coming in 
or going out. </p>
